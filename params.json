Reporting and Logging is not just another good to have feature,\r\nits integral to the whole process and with Unified Reporting is glued together at code level.\r\n###Unified Extractor-\r\nUnified Extractor, automates the process of scrapping HTML DOM elements into a lossely coupled JSON File, which then can be refered back to identify the \r\nweb page's controls. The JSON fiels hence generated are lite weight,CLR independent(Compile) and better adapted to external modifications.\r\n###Unified Components\r\nIn real world automation suites, there’s hardly a scenario where automation framework alone can complete everything E2E. \r\nSome requires Excel Read/Write functionality, Db connection mechanism, Sending email capability, Read/Write CSVs etc.In UF provides all these featues as pre baked APIs which will help you streamline these functionalities without breaking a sweat!.\r\n##Getting Started-\r\nTo get started with UnifiedFramework, Add reference from Nuget Package Manager into you project.\r\n[UnifiedFramework-Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/UnifiedFramework/)\r\n\r\n####Code snippet with explanation to assist in getting started with unified Framework.\r\n\r\n####Use these namespaces in your intial startup unit Test file as well\r\n\r\n* using System;\r\n* using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;\r\n* using System.IO;\r\n* using UnifiedFrameWork.Controller;\r\n* using System.Collections.Generic;\r\n* using UnifiedFrameWork.UCodeGenerator;\r\n* using UnifiedFrameWork.UComponents;\r\n* using System.Linq;\r\n\r\n#### Sample Test Method Construct\r\n\r\n    namespace SampleUFProject\r\n\t{\r\n    \t[TestClass]\r\n    \tpublic class SampleUnifiedClass\r\n    \t{\r\n        \t[TestMethod]\r\n        \tpublic void SampleMethod()\r\n        \t{\r\n            \t//Initiates the Unified Code Engine, Should be first line.\r\n            \tUCodeGen.Initiate();\r\n\r\n            //Namespace under which c# files will be generated\r\n            string nameSpace = \"MyProjectNamespace\";\r\n\r\n            //Primary config file of the project( probably will be inherited by other implmentators, \r\n            //hence is good candidate to act as base class) \r\n            string baseType = \"Config\";\r\n\r\n            //Determine the current projects root file, dynamically.
